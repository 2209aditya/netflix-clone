Docker Setup
Building Docker Images
To containerize both the frontend and backend, follow these steps:

Build Docker image for the Backend:

bash
Copy
docker build -t netflix-clone-backend ./backend
Build Docker image for the Frontend:

bash
Copy
docker build -t netflix-clone-frontend ./frontend
Running Locally with Docker
To run the application using Docker Compose (running both backend and frontend in containers):

Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory:

yaml
Copy
version: '3'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
Run Docker Compose:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up
This will start both the backend and frontend in their respective Docker containers, accessible at the following ports:

Backend: http://localhost:8080
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
