# Netflix Clone with DevOps Pipeline

This project is a Netflix-like clone application that demonstrates how to set up a DevOps pipeline using modern tools and technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure. The project includes both frontend (React.js) and backend (Node.js) components, containerized with Docker, and deployed on Kubernetes for scalability.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple clone of the Netflix streaming platform, featuring a frontend (React.js) and backend (Node.js). It demonstrates the use of **DevOps** best practices for automation, scalability, and deployment. 

- **Frontend**: React.js app providing the user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js API for handling user requests and interactions.
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data and media metadata.
- **Containerization**: Docker for creating portable, consistent application containers.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes to manage containers at scale.
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline for continuous integration and deployment with GitHub Actions.
- **Cloud**: Deployed to AWS/GCP/Azure (you can choose your preferred cloud provider).
  
## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express.js)
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab CI
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, GCP, or Azure
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To set up and run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Docker**: For building and running containers.
- **Kubernetes**: Local Kubernetes setup using Minikube or Docker Desktop, or access to a remote Kubernetes cluster (e.g., AWS EKS, GCP GKE, or Azure AKS).
- **kubectl**: Kubernetes CLI tool to interact with the cluster.
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for running backend and frontend locally).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and version control.

### Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-clone.git
cd netflix-clone
